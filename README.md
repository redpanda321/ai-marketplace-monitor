An intelligent tool that monitors Facebook Marketplace listings using AI to help you find the best deals. Get instant notifications when items matching your criteria are posted, with AI-powered analysis of each listing.

**📚 [Read the Full Documentation](https://ai-marketplace-monitor.readthedocs.io/)**

![Search In Action](docs/search_in_action.png)

Example notification from PushBullet:

```
Found 1 new gopro from facebook
[Great deal (5)] Go Pro hero 12
$180, Houston, TX
https://facebook.com/marketplace/item/1234567890
AI: Great deal; A well-priced, well-maintained camera meets all search criteria, with extra battery and charger.
```

## What's New

- **Built-in Web UI**: Edit config, add AI backends, and monitor live logs from your browser — starts automatically with the monitor. See [Web UI documentation](docs/webui.md).
- **Anthropic/Claude AI Backend**: Use Claude models (e.g. `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`) to evaluate listings alongside OpenAI, DeepSeek, Gemini, and Ollama. See [AI Services](docs/README.md#ai-services) for configuration.
- **Configurable Rate Limiting**: Rate limiting framework for all notification types with per-instance and global limits. Telegram notifications use optimized defaults automatically.

## ✨ Key Features

🔍 **Smart Search**

- Search multiple products using keywords
- Filter by price and location
- Exclude irrelevant results and spammers
- Support for different Facebook Marketplace layouts
- Configurable public-web connectors with normalized seller type and drivetrain

**Vehicle source policy**

| Source | Default | Collection path |
|---|---:|---|
| Facebook Marketplace | Enabled | Authenticated Playwright connector |
| Craigslist | Enabled | Public search and listing pages |
| Carpages | Disabled | Public connector; enable after configuring verified selectors |
| Kijiji | Disabled | Requires an authorized public source because vehicle search/RSS is disallowed by robots.txt |
| Tesla | Disabled | Requires authorized inventory access; robots access is denied |
| CarGurus | Disabled | Requires an authorized public source; search and listing APIs are disallowed |
| AutoTrader.ca | Disabled | Requires an authorized public source; `/lst` and listing-search APIs are disallowed |

Disabled connectors are included in the generated config so an authorized HTML source can be
attached without changing monitor code. The monitor does not bypass CAPTCHAs, private APIs,
or published crawler restrictions.

🤖 **AI-Powered**

- Multiple AI service providers supported
- Self-hosted model option (Ollama)

📱 **Notifications**

## 🚀 Quick Start

> **⚠️ Legal Notice**: Facebook's EULA prohibits automated data collection without authorization. This tool was developed for personal, hobbyist use only. You are solely responsible for ensuring compliance with platform terms and applicable laws.

### Installation

> **Requires Python 3.10 or higher.** Check your version with `python --version`. If your system default is older, use `pip3.10` (or `pip3.11`, `pip3.12`, etc.) instead of `pip`, or create a virtual environment with the correct version.

```bash
pip install ai-marketplace-monitor
playwright install
```

### Basic Configuration

Create `~/.ai-marketplace-monitor/config.toml`:

```toml
[marketplace.facebook]
search_city = 'houston'  # Replace with your city

[item.gopro]
search_phrases = 'Go Pro Hero 11'
min_price = 100
max_price = 300

[user.me]
pushbullet_token = 'your_token_here'  # Get from pushbullet.com
```

### Run the Monitor

```bash
ai-marketplace-monitor
```

The program will open a browser, search Facebook Marketplace, and notify you of matching items. A web UI also starts automatically at [http://127.0.0.1:8467](http://127.0.0.1:8467) for editing config and monitoring logs — see [Web UI Guide](docs/webui.md).

### Run with Docker

A prebuilt Linux image is published to GitHub Container Registry. It bundles Python, Playwright Chromium, a virtual display (Xvfb), and an embedded noVNC client so you can solve Facebook CAPTCHAs / interactive logins from the web UI — useful on macOS, headless servers, or NAS boxes.

```bash
docker run -d --name aimm \
  -p 8467:8467 \
  -v "$HOME/.ai-marketplace-monitor:/root/.ai-marketplace-monitor" \
  -e FACEBOOK_USERNAME -e FACEBOOK_PASSWORD \
  -e ANTHROPIC_API_KEY \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  ghcr.io/bopeng/ai-marketplace-monitor:latest
```

Then open [http://localhost:8467](http://localhost:8467). When Facebook needs an interactive login or CAPTCHA, click the **Browser** button in the header to view and control the in-container Chromium.

Mounting `~/.ai-marketplace-monitor` shares your existing config, cache, and logs between the host install and the container — so you can switch back and forth freely. Update with `docker pull ghcr.io/bopeng/ai-marketplace-monitor:latest && docker restart aimm`.

To build the image yourself instead of pulling: `docker build -t aimm .` from a checkout of this repo.

For a reverse-proxy deployment under a path such as `/marketplace-monitor`, set
`AIMM_WEBUI_BASE_PATH=/marketplace-monitor`. Use dedicated
`AIMM_WEBUI_USERNAME` and `AIMM_WEBUI_PASSWORD` values to protect the UI instead
of sharing the Facebook account password with UI operators.

## 💡 Example Usage

**Find GoPro cameras under $300:**

```toml
[item.gopro]
search_phrases = 'Go Pro Hero'
keywords = "('Go Pro' OR gopro) AND (11 OR 12 OR 13)"
min_price = 100
max_price = 300
```

**Search nationwide with shipping:**

```toml
[item.rare_item]
search_phrases = 'vintage collectible'
search_region = 'usa'
delivery_method = 'shipping'
seller_locations = []
```

**AI-powered filtering:**

```toml
[ai.openai]
api_key = 'your_openai_key'

[item.camera]
description = '''High-quality DSLR camera in good condition.
Exclude listings with water damage or missing parts.'''
rating = 4  # Only notify for 4+ star AI ratings
```
