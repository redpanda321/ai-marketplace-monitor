"""Extract web UI credentials from the config file.

Two modes:

1. A ``[marketplace.*]`` section has ``username`` and ``password`` set,
   or the ``FACEBOOK_USERNAME`` / ``FACEBOOK_PASSWORD`` environment
   variables are present → the web UI gates access behind those
   credentials.

2. Nothing set → **open mode**. The web UI runs without authentication
   but only on loopback (127.0.0.1).  ``--webui-host`` is disallowed
   in this mode so the instance can only be accessed locally.
